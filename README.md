# TestingFramework
1.)The reports will be present in the directory TestingFramework\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\TestReport

2.)The userName and the password for the application are present in appSettings.Debug.json. This file is expected to be ignored in gitignore file so  that the important credentials should not be checked-in the repository. Right now I have not ignored this file in ignore so that it does not harm the execution in the others machine.
